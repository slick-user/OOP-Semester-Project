wrote plain but I mean plan... nvm that

How we plan to do this project....

Classes

Base Class :
_____________
Junior


_____________
Employee 

-> PolicyEngine controls permission tests: 
    What can be allowed? 
    so I guess we put bool functions in PolicyEngine 

TimeManager

Task
- creator
- assignee
- timestamps
- status

// Authentication & Credential Security
    Store and credentials in users.txt
    Hash Passwords

// Task System
    Tasks Can be Created, Assigned, InProgress, Completed, Expired
    Can delegate tasks to some one with same clearance or higher clearance

So one of the first systems we should get done is the messaging after that we could add the task system, think that would be a good way to get this done.
