# OSIM - Organizational Simulation and Internal Management System

Was my (Azlan Ali Khan) and Sameer Hussain's Final Project for our OOP Course

## Project Overview
OSIM simulates an internal organizational environment where users with different roles (Junior, Manager, Director, Executive) interact through tasks, messages, and resources. All access is strictly governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), clearance levels, and centralized
policy enforcement. Key activities include task delegation, secure messaging, and audit logging, all with runtime accountability and secure operation tracking.

## Learning Objectives
● Implement multi-level inheritance and runtime polymorphism
● Enforce access control using role-based permissions
● Use only pointers and manual memory management (no STL)
● Overload operators to support task and resource handling
● Serialize/deserialize data to/from text and binary files
● Log all significant user behavior securely and immutably

## Core Functional Requirements
1. User System & RBAC
2. Authentication & Credential Security
